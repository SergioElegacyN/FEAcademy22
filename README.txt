This is the final proyect of the Front End Academy.

Objetive: Made an Online CV with data generated by "randomuser" API.

For this proyect I gonna use :

- HTML5 : to print the info in screen.
- JavaScript : to connect with the API and GET the info in JSON, after that I gonna send the info to my INDEX.HTML files.
- CSS3 : for styles I gonna use CSS3 with BOOTSTRAP library, to give personality to the INDEX.HTML file.
- JQUERY : for call BOOTSTRAP succesfully.
- BOOTSTRAP : to made the document responsive using the column system.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
I gonna divide the body into four parts: I-II-III-IV

The part I consist in : photo + name + surname
This with a gradient combination for the back-ground, the name and surname into a h1 in the right corner and the pic in the left side of the screen. 

The part II consist in : about me + contact info
This with another gradient combination for the back-ground, the "about me" section will be displayed with a Lorem Ipsum.
While the contact info will be called from the SCRIPT.JS file.

The part III gonna consist of : experience + studies
For this I can't use the "randomuser" API, so will be generated by a Lorem Ipsum.
The back-ground will have a solid colour.

The part IV will consist in : next candidate + send text + download cv
Here I gonna give to the document some utilities.
The "next candidate" will be a button with the property to refresh the cv information.
The "send text" will be a form to contact the candidate.
The "download cv" will download the cv into a .pdf file.
